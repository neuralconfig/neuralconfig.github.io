## Approach to AI Development

NeuralConfig believes AI systems that interact with production infrastructure must be built with safety as a first principle. All autonomous agents include:

1. **Human-in-the-loop**: Destructive or irreversible actions require explicit approval
2. **Comprehensive logging**: Full audit trail for all AI decisions
3. **Graceful degradation**: Systems handle uncertainty safely
4. **Approval workflows**: Production changes require human verification
